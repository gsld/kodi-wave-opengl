# kodi-wave-opengl
Missing Waveform and OpenGL spectrum animations.
As of kodi ver 16.0 release the OpenGL and Waverform visualization for music are no loger provided. They have instead been replaced by the vortex visualization.
Download the zip file and copy the contents to the same folder in your Kodi install.
Reboot the device and you should have your new visualizations.
